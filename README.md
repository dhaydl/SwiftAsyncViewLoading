# SwiftAsyncViewLoading

SwiftAsyncViewLoading is a Swift Package that makes loading content asynchronously into a SwiftUI view easy. The source code comes from [this Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/handling-loading-states-in-swiftui/) article while the package only includes the parts I need in my projects.

For further insight into how this code is working in detail, please visit the linked article. Because this code is designed for SwiftUI with some components from later versions of the framework, it can only be run on iOS 14 and above and macOS 10.15 and above.
